    crew: ["Yuri Gagarin"],
    duration: "108 minutes",
    content: `
Preparations:
Unlike later Vostok missions, there were no dedicated tracking ships available to receive signals from the spacecraft. Instead, they relied on the network of ground stations, also called Command Points, to communicate with the spacecraft; all of these Command Points were located within the Soviet Union. 
Because of weight constraints, there was no backup retrorocket engine. The spacecraft carried 13 days of provisions to allow for survival and natural orbital decay in the event the retrorockets failed. The provisions included food for Gagarin, including liver meat puree and chocolate sauce packed in metal toothpaste-style tubes.
The letters "СССР" were hand-painted onto Gagarin's helmet by engineer Gherman Lebedev during transfer to the launch site, to avoid the risk of being mistaken for a spy upon landing.

Flight:
At 05:30 Moscow time, on the morning of 12 April 1961, both Gagarin and his backup Titov were woken. They were given breakfast, assisted into their spacesuits, and then were transported to the launch pad. Gagarin entered the Vostok 1 spacecraft, and at 07:10 local time (04:10 UTC), the radio communication system was turned on. Once Gagarin was in the spacecraft, his picture appeared on television screens in the launch control room from an onboard camera. Launch would not occur for another two hours, and during this time Gagarin chatted with the mission's main CapCom and Chief Designer Sergei Korolev, joking and singing songs.
Following a series of tests and checks, about forty minutes after Gagarin entered the spacecraft, its hatch was closed. Gagarin reported that the hatch was not sealed properly, and technicians spent 15 minutes resealing it. Vostok's chief designer, Oleg Ivanovsky, personally helped rebolt the hatch.
Korolev reportedly suffered chest pains due to high anxiety; the Soviet space launch success rate was only 50%. Gagarin remained calm, with a recorded pulse of 64 beats per minute half an hour before launch.

      "Lunar Trailblazer was a small (class D) lunar orbiter, part of NASA's SIMPLEx program, with a mission to detect and map water on the lunar surface in a 100km orbit.",
    crew: ["Bethany Ehlmann (PI)"],
    duration: "Mission ended July 2025",
    content: `
Mission:
The mission aimed to aid understanding of lunar water and the Moon's water cycle. Lunar Trailblazer was launched as a secondary payload on the IM-2 mission. Soon after launch, NASA lost contact with the spacecraft, and the mission was ended in July 2025.

Objectives:
• measure and map the amount, location and form (hydroxyl, H2O, or ice) of lunar water and determine any correlation to latitude and surface makeup
• study the time-variability of lunar water in sunlit portions of the Moon
• determine the form, amount, and location of lunar water in permanently shadowed parts of the Moon
• study how changes in surface temperature affect concentrations of water and ice
• search for good locations for future lunar landings

Spacecraft:
The Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft was built and tested by Lockheed Martin. It used two deployable solar arrays, which provided 280 watts of power, and a chemical propulsion system. With its solar panels fully extended it was 3.5 m long. The spacecraft weighed 200 kg. It carried two science instruments, High Resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper (HVM3) and the Lunar Thermal Mapper (LTM). HVM3 was provided by JPL and LTM by the University of Oxford.

      "NASA's Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission was a robotic space mission involving two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, exploring the planet Mars. It began in 2003 with the launch of the two rovers to explore the Martian surface and geology; both landed on Mars at separate locations in January 2004. Both rovers far outlived their planned missions of 90 Martian solar days: MER-A Spirit was active until March 22, 2010, while MER-B Opportunity was active until June 10, 2018.",
    crew: ["Managed by JPL"],
    duration: "16+ years of exploration combined",
    content: `
Rover Design / Project History:
The rovers are six-wheeled, solar-powered robots that stand 1.5 m high, 2.3 m wide, and 1.6 m long. They weigh 180 kg, 35 kg of which is the wheel and suspension system. The main box-like chassis forms the Warm Electronics Box (WEB).

Objectives:
• Search for and characterize rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity.
• Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils around landing sites.
• Determine geologic processes shaping the terrain.
• Validate surface observations made by MRO instruments.
• Identify iron-containing minerals formed in water.
• Characterize mineralogy and rock textures.
• Search for clues about past environmental conditions.
• Assess whether environments were conducive to life.

The total cost of building, launching, landing and operating the rovers on the surface for the initial 90-sol primary mission was US$820 million. Each rover received five mission extensions, as they continued to function past their initially planned duration. 
The fifth mission extension was granted in October 2007, and ran to the end of 2009. The total cost of the first four mission extensions was $104 million, and the fifth mission extension cost at least $20 million. The mission was managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which designed, built, and operated the rovers.

Mission Timeline:
NASA extended the Spirit and Opportunity rover missions multiple times after their initial three-month plans because both rovers continued to function well and deliver valuable science. Opportunity explored several major craters, including Endurance, Victoria, and Endeavour, while Spirit studied the Columbia Hills and reached the summit of Husband Hill in 2005. Despite challenges such as dust storms, reduced solar power, and mechanical failures—including Spirit’s broken wheel—the rovers far exceeded expectations.
Spirit became trapped in soft sand in 2009 and was eventually repurposed as a stationary research platform before contact was lost in 2011. Opportunity, however, continued driving for years, breaking off-Earth distance records and eventually completing a full marathon distance on Mars. The rovers collectively returned hundreds of thousands of images and provided strong evidence of past water and potentially habitable environments on Mars. Opportunity’s mission ended in 2019 after a global dust storm cut off power and communication, closing a highly successful 16-year mission. `,

Project history
 
In July 2024, ESA's Space Safety Programme has received permission to begin preparatory work for Ramses. The project has been awarded 1.5 million euros for the preparations and in October 2024, ESA signed a contract with OHB Italia SpA for preliminary work on the mission. ESA also unveiled the official mission patch. In July 2024, India expressed interest on developing an instrument for Ramses.
In March 2025, ESA has selected the first of two CubeSats to fly onboard Ramses. The mission team revealed that they were considering whether the second CubeSat could be a lander that would touch down on Apophis. In April 2025, ESA has selected the Spanish company Emxys to build the second
CubeSat, indeed intended to land on Apophis, and GomSpace (Denmark) to provide system 
engineering support for the lander
CubeSat project.

In August 2025, JAXA has made an 
official funding request to the
 Government of Japan to participate 
in the mission. JAXA plans to 
contribute the probe's solar arrays,
 infrared imager, and a rideshare 
launch on the H3 rocket. On the Euro
pean side, the funding decision was 
expected to be made in late 2025 at
 the ESA ministerial council. 
Speaking at EPSC-DPS meeting in
 September 2025, Ramses Project Manager Paolo Martino confirmed that the project was fully on schedule. The Preliminary Design Review had been completed previous year, and the Critical Design Review was expected in November 2025. At the ministerial council in late November 2025, ESA member states approved funding for the mission, together with a substantial increase in the budget of the Space Safety Programme.

 CubeSats:
The first selected CubeSat will be built by Tyvak International (Italy), a company that developed the Milani CubeSat for the Hera mission. The small spacecraft will combine the dust analyser of Milani with the low-frequency radar of Juventas, another CubeSat of Hera. The dust analyser will study material released from the surface of Apophis and the radar will investigate the asteroid's internal structure.
The second CubeSat, being developed by a consortium led by Emxys (Spain), will attempt landing on Apophis. Its main task will be to provide high resolution imagery of the asteroid's surface from a distance of just a few kilometres. If the landing is successful, the CubeSat will also measure the asteroid's seismic activity during its exceptionally close flyby of Earth. Emxys previously contributed to the GRASS gravimeter on Hera's Juventas CubeSat.

The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the United States human spaceflight program led by NASA, which landed the first humans on the Moon in 1969. Apollo was conceived during Project Mercury and executed after Project Gemini. It was conceived in 1960 as a three-person spacecraft during the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower. Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal for the 1960s of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."

The Apollo program (1961–1972) fulfilled President John F. Kennedy’s goal of landing humans on the Moon and returning them safely to Earth. This was first achieved by Apollo 11, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. In total, six Apollo missions successfully landed on the Moon, allowing twelve astronauts to walk on its surface.

The program faced serious challenges, including the tragic Apollo 1 fire in 1967 and the aborted Apollo 13 landing after an onboard explosion. Despite this, Apollo achieved major milestones, returned 382 kg of lunar samples, and advanced computing, navigation, and spacecraft engineering.

Apollo 8
Apollo 8 (December 21–27, 1968) was the first crewed spacecraft to leave Earth's gravitational influence and orbit the Moon. The astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders orbited the Moon ten times and captured the first Earthrise photograph.

Mission insignia and callsign
The triangular shape of the insignia represents the Apollo Command Module. A red figure-eight loops around Earth and the Moon, symbolizing the mission number and lunar orbit. The names of the crew appear along the bottom. The design was created by Jim Lovell.

The crew wished to name their spacecraft, but NASA did not permit it. They would have chosen “Columbiad,” inspired by Jules Verne’s novel *From the Earth to the Moon*.

Lunar sphere of influence
The Service Propulsion System ignited 69 hours after launch and burned for over four minutes, inserting Apollo 8 into lunar orbit. The maneuver had to be precise—too long and the spacecraft would crash, too short and it would drift into space. Once confirmed in orbit, the crew spent 20 hours circling the Moon while Mission Control monitored from Earth.
